-- MESA_WD_primer --

This is a tutorial/lab written for Ed Brown's research group at MSU on getting setup with MESA and getting nova simulations going. Check out mesa_wd_tutorial.pdf to get started.


! INCOMPLETE !
Current version of pdf only has sections 1 and 2 -- Intro/install and a test suite example -- as well as an "appendix" of useful material. Unlikely to see any updates.
